# Glossary

Domain terminology and definitions for ProcureFlow.

## A

**Agent**  
AI-powered conversational interface that processes natural language requests to search catalog, add items to cart, and complete checkout. Built with LangChain and OpenAI function calling.

**Agent Memory**  
Conversation context stored in MongoDB to maintain state across messages, including previous items mentioned and cart state.

**API Route**  
Next.js server-side endpoint in `app/(app)/api/` that handles HTTP requests. Thin wrapper around service layer functions.

**Autoscaling**  
Cloud Run's automatic adjustment of container instances based on concurrent request load (target: 80 requests/instance).

## B

**Barrel Export**  
Pattern where feature exports all public APIs through `index.ts` file. Consumers import from feature root: `import { searchItems } from '@/features/catalog'`.

**Blue/Green Deployment**  
Deployment strategy with two identical environments (blue=current, green=new). Traffic shifts 100% to green after validation. Not implemented in v1.0.

## C

**C4 Model**  
Architecture visualization framework with 4 levels: Context (system boundary), Container (deployable units), Component (code modules), Code (classes). ProcureFlow uses Context and Container diagrams.

**Cart**  
Shopping cart containing items to purchase. Stored in MongoDB `carts` collection. Supports add, update, remove, clear operations.

**Catalog**  
Master list of available procurement items. Searchable via MongoDB text index. Items have name, category, description, estimated price, status.

**Cloud Run**  
GCP serverless container platform hosting ProcureFlow. Auto-scales from 0-2 instances (dev) based on traffic.

**Cold Start**  
Startup latency (~2-4s) when Cloud Run scales from 0 instances. Mitigated in production by maintaining min 1 instance.

**Concurrency**  
Number of simultaneous HTTP requests handled by single container instance. ProcureFlow target: 80 concurrent requests/instance.

**Conventional Commits**  
Commit message format: `type(scope): subject`. Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf.

## D

**Domain Entity**  
Framework-agnostic TypeScript interface representing business concept (e.g., `Item`, `Cart`, `PurchaseRequest`). Defined in `domain/entities.ts`.

**Duplicate Detection**  
ML-powered feature that identifies similar catalog items before creation to prevent duplicates. Not implemented in v1.0.

## E

**Executive Summary**  
8-line overview at top of every documentation page summarizing key points, metrics, and outcomes.

## F

**Feature-Based Structure**  
Code organization pattern where each business domain (catalog, cart, checkout, agent, auth) lives in isolated `features/<name>/` directory with components, services, types.

**Function Calling**  
OpenAI technique where LLM decides which tools to execute (search_catalog, add_to_cart, checkout) based on user message.

## H

**Health Check**  
API endpoint (`/api/health`) that returns 200 status with database connection state. Used by Cloud Run to determine service health.

## I

**IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**  
Pulumi TypeScript code in `packages/infra/pulumi/gcp/` that provisions Cloud Run service, secrets, networking.

## L

**LangChain**  
Framework for building LLM applications. ProcureFlow uses it for agent tool orchestration and conversation management.

## M

**Mermaid**  
Diagram-as-code syntax embedded in documentation. Used for C4 diagrams, flowcharts, sequence diagrams.

**Mongoose**  
MongoDB ODM (Object Document Mapper) for Node.js. Provides schema definition, validation, type safety. Models in `lib/db/models.ts`.

## N

**NextAuth.js**  
Authentication library for Next.js. ProcureFlow uses JWT strategy with 30-day session expiration.

**Nextra**  
Documentation framework built on Next.js. Powers this documentation site with MDX support and docs theme.

**NFR (Non-Functional Requirement)**  
System quality attributes: performance (p95 latency <2s), security (bcrypt, JWT), reliability (99.5% uptime), observability (Winston logs, Prometheus metrics).

## O

**OpenAPI**  
API specification standard (OpenAPI 3.0.3). ProcureFlow spec manually maintained at `/api/openapi` endpoint with 13 routes and 7 schemas.

## P

**Pulumi**  
Infrastructure as Code platform. ProcureFlow uses TypeScript Pulumi programs to manage GCP resources (Cloud Run, Secret Manager, Artifact Registry).

**Purchase Request (PR)**  
Immutable snapshot of cart at checkout time. Stored in `purchaseRequests` collection with items array, total price, status, timestamps.

## R

**Revision**  
Cloud Run deployment version. Each deployment creates new revision (e.g., `procureflow-web-00042-xyz`). Traffic can split between revisions for rollback.

**Rollback**  
Reverting to previous stable version. Cloud Run: shift 100% traffic to previous revision (2-5 min). Pulumi: revert infrastructure code (10-30 min).

## S

**Scale-to-Zero**  
Cloud Run feature terminating all instances after 15 min idle. Enabled in dev for cost savings ($0 when idle). Disabled in production to avoid cold starts.

**Service Layer**  
Business logic layer in `*.service.ts` files. Database-agnostic, framework-agnostic functions returning domain entities.

**Smoke Test**  
Post-deployment verification: health check returns 200, root endpoint accessible, catalog search functional.

**SLO (Service Level Objective)**  
Performance target: p95 API latency <2s, catalog search <500ms, checkout <2s, 99.5% uptime, <0.1% error rate.

## T

**Text Index**  
MongoDB index enabling full-text search. Created on `items` collection fields: name, category, description. Required for catalog search.

**Traffic Split**  
Cloud Run feature dividing traffic between revisions (0-100%). Used for gradual rollout or instant rollback.

**Turbopack**  
Next.js fast bundler (Rust-based). Used in Next.js 16+ dev mode for faster compilation.

## V

**Vitest**  
Test framework for unit and integration tests. Configuration in `vitest.config.ts`. Coverage thresholds: 60% lines/functions/branches/statements.
